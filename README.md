# ✨ Needle: A Database for Image Content Retrieval

Needle is an advanced system for Image retrieval, designed to empower researchers and developers with a powerful tool for querying **images** using natural language descriptions. It’s based on the research presented in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00639), introducing a novel approach to efficient and scalable retrieval.

🚀 **Why Needle?**
- Seamlessly retrieve image content from large datasets.
- Extendable and modular design to fit various research needs.
- Backed by cutting-edge research for accurate and robust retrieval.
- 200% improvement over CLIP from OpenAI

## 🔍 A Little About `needlectl`

`needlectl` is the core command-line utility for interacting with Needle. It allows you to:
- 🔎 Perform searches on multimedia datasets.
- 🛠️ Add or update image datasets (directories) for retrieval.

With `needlectl`, you can easily integrate Needle into your workflows for seamless and intuitive operation.
